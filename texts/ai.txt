Current explainable AI (XAI) approaches prioritize algorithmic transparency and present explanations in abstract, non-adaptive formats that often fail to support meaningful end-user understanding. This paper introduces "Explanatory AI" as a complementary paradigm that leverages generative AI capabilities to serve as explanatory partners for human understanding rather than providers of algorithmic transparency. While XAI reveals algorithmic decision processes for model validation, Explanatory AI addresses contextual reasoning to support human decision-making in sociotechnical contexts. We develop a definition and systematic eight-dimensional conceptual model distinguishing Explanatory AI through narrative communication, adaptive personalization, and progressive disclosure principles. Empirical validation through Rapid Contextual Design methodology with healthcare professionals demonstrates that users consistently prefer context-sensitive, multimodal explanations over technical transparency. Our findings reveal the practical urgency for AI systems designed for human comprehension rather than algorithmic introspection, establishing a comprehensive research agenda for advancing user-centered AI explanation approaches across diverse domains and cultural contexts.This technical report accompanies the LLM robustness leaderboard published by PRISM Eval for the Paris AI Action Summit. We introduce PRISM Eval Behavior Elicitation Tool (BET), an AI system performing automated red-teaming through Dynamic Adversarial Optimization that achieves 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against 37 of 41 state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond binary success metrics, we propose a fine-grained robustness metric estimating the average number of attempts required to elicit harmful behaviors, revealing that attack difficulty varies by over 300-fold across models despite universal vulnerability. We introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.
